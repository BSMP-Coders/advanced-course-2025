## üß† What is AI Literacy?

AI is everywhere ‚Äî from TikTok filters to homework help to AI music and stories. But:

* AI is not *magic* ‚Äî it's just math trained on patterns in data.
* AI doesn't "think" like a human ‚Äî it **predicts** what might come next.

### Why AI Literacy Matters:

Knowing how to use AI wisely means you can:

* **Recognize** when content is made by AI
* **Question** if it's fair, accurate, or biased
* **Use** AI to create responsibly

## üåç What is Responsible AI and Ethics?

Responsible AI means treating people fairly and keeping technology in check.
Here are the **4 Big Ideas** to remember:

| üîç Concept         | What it Means                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fairness**       | AI should not be biased or treat people unfairly                |
| **Transparency**   | We should know when something is created by AI                  |
| **Privacy**        | AI shouldn‚Äôt collect or share personal info without permission  |
| **Accountability** | Humans (not AI) should be responsible when something goes wrong |

### Think About This:

* Should AI decide who gets a scholarship?
* Can AI content influence what you believe?
* What happens when people **can‚Äôt tell** something is fake?

### Responsible AI Checklist
The checklist is organized into six sections, each dedicated to a key principle of responsible AI. Within each section, a series of questions prompts project managers and developers to critically assess both technical and process-oriented aspects of their AI/ML models.


1. Fairness
Focuses on identifying and mitigating biases, ensuring data diversity, and employing fairness metrics. It encourages regular audits and stakeholder engagement to define and uphold fairness standards.


2. Reliability and Safety
Ensures AI systems handle errors effectively, perform reliably, and incorporate safety measures. It covers testing methodologies, risk assessments, and procedures for addressing safety incidents.


3. Privacy and Security
Addresses data protection, security protocols, and compliance with data privacy regulations. It also outlines governance frameworks for data access and control.


4. Inclusiveness
Aims to make AI systems accessible to all, including those from marginalized or underrepresented communities. It stresses the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusiveness.


5. Transparency
Encourages explainability, comprehensive documentation, and open communication with stakeholders about the AI system's capabilities, limitations, and the decision-making process.


6. Accountability
Establishes frameworks for responsibility, audit trails, and remediation processes to address negative impacts. It promotes continuous monitoring and improvement of AI systems.
